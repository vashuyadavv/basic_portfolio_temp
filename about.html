                    <p>A full stack developer is a web developer or engineer who works with both the front and 
                    back ends of a website or application—meaning they can tackle projects that involve 
                    databases, building user-facing websites, or even work with clients during the planning
                    phase of projects.</p> 

                    <p>As the line between what can be done on the front end versus back end
                    increasingly blurs, more developers are becoming what we call “full stack.” A lot of 
                    employers (especially agencies who work on different kinds of sites) are looking for
                    developers who know how to work on all the parts of a site, so they can use the best tools
                    r the job regardless of whether it’s technically “front end” or “back end.”</p>

                    <p>Hence the rise in companies listing full stack development on job requirements. Now, contrary to what a lot 
                    of people think, “full stack” doesn’t necessarily mean a developer is writing all of a 
                    site’s code themselves. Many full stack web developers spend the majority of their time
                    in either the front or back end code of a site.</p>
